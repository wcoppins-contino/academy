docker-compose commands go in DOCKER-COMPOSE.yml
compose is an orchestration tool used to run multiple containers at once 
e.g. an entire app structure.
Is also often used in CI pipelines to run a series of tests on all the app components and make sure they all talk together properly

DOCKER-COMPOSE.yml example:

version: '3'
services:
  web: 							#friendly name for service
    build: . 					#the Dockerfile is in local dir
    ports:						#ports to open host:container
      - "5000:5000"
  redis: 						#friendlyname
    image: "redis:alpine"		#image name (remote)
	
	
CMD: docker-compose up -d 
Will create the above containers, as well as a local network for them to talk to each other, and 
some custom DNS resolution so they can talk to each other using their service names
